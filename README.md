The game   creates new invaders and moves them down the screen.
Bullets are shot from the player's ship towards the invaders.
 a hit detection is implemented to detect collision between the player's ship, invaders, and bullets.
The game ends when an invader collides with the player's ship.
A simple alert message displays "Game Over!" when the game ends.
